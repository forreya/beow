This file is to remind myself what I was up to in the previous session so I can easily get back on track with the same ideas / solutions I was having.

- Just finished setting up AWS CLI configuration, now need to setup `boto3` module to link up with Amazon S3.
- Use the mp3 object key for the database field and dynamically create the mp3 URL using the public + secret keys.
